# Charlie Table

This project was motivated by a very simple problem: I want to take a day trip to Providence. When should I leave and come back? I don't really care whether I take Amtrak or the MBTA, and I don't want to dig around on a couple poorly designed websites for timetables. Google is OK if I know I want to leave at 9am sharp, but what if I just want to know when I *can* leave?

Similarly, when I lived in Union Square in Somerville, I would meet friends for drinks in Davis. I could take either the 87 or 88 bus back, both of which run relatively infrequently late at night. Should I leave now, or stay for a few more drinks?

Agency timetables aren't too helpful for these types of situations because one would have to cross-reference numerous routes' tables, depending on a particular start and end -- especially if your itinerary requires a few transfers. Map-based applications like Google Maps are OK, but really I care much less about the map and much more about the timetable.

In essence, this turned out to be a design problem. How do you display a potentially very large amount of time information in a usable, readable, searchable fashion?
